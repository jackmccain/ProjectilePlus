# ProjectilePlus

ProjectilePlus is a plugin that gives a multitude of new features to projectiles. Snowballs, eggs, bows, or even fishing rods are now much more usable in PvP. This plugin enables projectiles to create explosions, create lightning bolts, create fire charges, teleport a player, among other PVP-enhancing functions.

###Different Projectiles

The ability of a certain projectile is determined by its name. If you were to rename a snowball or a bow "explode" it would create an explosion where the arrow lands. If you were to rename a snowball "cobweb" it would create a cobweb wherever the projectile lands. Keep in mind that the item names are not case sensitive so if you rename a snowball "ExPloDe" it would still function regularly.

In order to use each projectile ability, a player must have the permission attached to that ability. Below is a list of all the abilities, the name necessary to use them, and the permission necessary to use them.
